# FEniCS Requirements (Optional - install separately if needed)
# Note: FEniCS is not available via pip and must be installed separately
# See: https://fenicsproject.org/download/

# These are the FEniCS packages that would be needed if FEniCS is installed
# dolfin>=2019.1.0
# fenics>=2019.1.0
# ffc>=2019.1.0
# mshr>=2019.1.0

# realistic-looking results for testing and demonstration purposes.
